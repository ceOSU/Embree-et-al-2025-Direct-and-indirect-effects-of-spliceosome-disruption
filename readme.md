# Github repository for Embree et al 2025 "Direct and indirect effects of spliceosome disruption compromise gene regulation by Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay" 
Contains the R scripts used to do all final analyses, organized according to type of analysis. 
The folder final_plots contains the script integrating the analysis for all knockdowns to make the figures published in the manuscript. 
All supplemental tables refered to in the paper are also included, as some were too large to host elsewhere.

The copy_files.sh script can be ignored, it is just there to facilitate easier updating to the repository from our file structure.
